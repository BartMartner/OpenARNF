# OpenARNF
As of September 30th, 2022, I'm releasing the unity project files for A Robot Named Fight to the public. The game and the source code are being provided to you for the purpose of learning, entertainment, and sharing with the A Robot Named Fight community.

I can't wait to see what y'all create!
